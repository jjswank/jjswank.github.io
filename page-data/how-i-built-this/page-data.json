I only have to pay for the amount of traffic I receive. There is no cost to idle servers. With github pages, there is not cost of hosting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Because this site is just static files served from a CDN there are no backend servers to worry about going down in the middle of the night.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Becuase pages are not dynamically rendered the site renders quickly. The site renders quickly if there is 1 view or 1 million views.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>How it works</h1>\n<p>GatsbyJS follows a JAM stack achritecture. Instead of dynamically rendering pages everytime they are requested the pages a pre-rendered up front into a static page. Whenever the page is changed it wil be rerendered. This is great for SEO bacause search engines can read the pages easier.</p>\n<p>The trade off is between speed of rendering vs speed to applying changes. In my case because page updates are made much less than pages are views, it makes much more sense to prioritize speed of rendering.</p>\n<h1>Hosting</h1>\n<p>The site is hosted using github pages. Therefore there is no hosting cost to me. Github host the site from a git repository.</p>\n<h1>Getting Started</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new gatsby project using the gatsby-starter-blog template. This contains a basic blog with all the features needed to get started.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npx gatsby new &lt;YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog</code></pre></div>\n<p>To run the blog locally run:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npx gatsby develop</code></pre></div>\n<p>Blog pages are stored as markdown files in <code class=\"language-text\">content\\blog</code>. While developing, any changes will hot reload. To add a blog post, add a new folder to the <code class=\"language-text\">content\\blog</code> directory with an index.md file. Save the file and view the changes at <a href=\"http://localhost:8000\">http://localhost:8000</a></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Install the <code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages</code> package which will handle publishing the built production app to a seperate branch which will be served as the github page.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm install gh-pages --save-dev</code></pre></div>\n<p>In your <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code> add the following deployment script:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">\"deploy\": \"gatsby build &amp;&amp; gh-pages -d public -f\"</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will build a production version of the app with all the static assets generatde in a folder called <code class=\"language-text\">public</code>. Then it will take the contents of the public folder and push it to a branch in github called <code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages</code>. To manually deploy the site run:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm run deploy</code></pre></div>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>To set up the git repository, create a new repository with the name <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io</code> and follow the instructions to push your app to the repo on the main branch.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To enable github pages, fo the repository settings, selecte pages, and change the source branch to gh-pages. Once you save and deploy the site you should see the blog hosted at &#x3C;YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io</p>\n<h1>Up Next</h1>\n<p>I’d like to automate the deploys any time a commit is merged into the main branch. I’d also like to add a wysiwyg editor to replace manually editing the markdown files.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How I Built This","description":"Hello World personal blog with GatsbyJS"}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-i-built-this-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Part 2: How I Built This"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c9cbdb0a-397a-59a4-b98c-5ff911262861","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"e9c68606-3fd4-595c-93c5-d634ac360be6"}},
